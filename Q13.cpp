//Q.13 Write a program to print the roll number and average marks of 8 students in three subjects (each out of 100). The marks are entered by the user and the roll numbers are automatically assigned.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct student
{
    char name[50];
    int roll;
    float marks;
} s[10];

int main()
{
    cout << "Enter information of students: " << endl;

    for(int i = 0; i < 8; ++i)
    {
        s[i].roll = i+1;
        cout << "For roll number" << s[i].roll << "," << endl;

        cout << "Enter name: ";
        cin >> s[i].name;

        cout << "Enter marks: ";
        cin >> s[i].marks;

        cout << endl;
    }

    cout << "Displaying Information: " << endl;

        for(int i = 0; i < 8; ++i)
    {
        cout << "\nRoll number: " << i+1 << endl;
        cout << "Name: " << s[i].name << endl;
        cout << "Marks: " << s[i].marks << endl;
    }

    return 0;
